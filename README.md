- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @DaveDurandal
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in developing automated process, using batch files, python, and SQL. 
- âš¡ Fun fact: I've been a on/off player of Eve Online for a number of years. The in-game economy is excellent for testing out spreadsheet skills, and the developers have an API allowing for very interesting potential use cases. 

<!---
I'm not a software developer by trade or training, everything is self-taught over many years as I find time. Arduino and robotics programming were my first interests many years ago, and I've expanded into cybersecurity since. 

Automating as many tasks as possible is a personal goal of mine, I hate repetitive and boring tasks. 

If you're new to programming, I'll always teach you what I can. If you have suggestions for how I should change something, I'm always listening and ready to learn!
